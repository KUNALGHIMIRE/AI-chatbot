**AI Chatbot**

A real-time AI-powered chatbot developed using Python and Flask.
This project demonstrates practical skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP), REST API development, and frontend–backend integration.
The chatbot processes user input and generates intelligent, human-like responses through a simple web interface.

**Project Overview**

Designed and implemented a Flask-based backend for handling chat requests
Built a responsive web interface for real-time user interaction
Integrated a custom-trained NLP model for generating responses
Followed a modular and clean project structure suitable for real-world deployment
This project was developed as part of hands-on learning in AI and web-based systems and is suitable for AI / ML / Software Engineering internships.
